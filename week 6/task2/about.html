        Earth is a unique planet as it is the only planet that sustains life. 
        Life is possible on Earth because of many reasons, and 
        the most important among them is the availability of water and oxygen. 
        Earth is a part of the family of the Sun. It belongs to the Solar System.
        Earth, along with seven other planets, revolves around the Sun.
        It takes roughly twenty-four hours to complete one rotation and 365 days and
        4 hours to complete one revolution. Rotation and revolution make day and
        night and change of seasons simultaneously possible
        The five seasons we experience in one revolution are Spring, Summer, Monsoon, Autumn, and Winter.
        However, we are misusing resources and exploiting the natural gifts that have been so heavily endowed upon us.
        Overuse and misuse of all the natural resources are causing pollution to such an extent that it has become alarming to the point of destruction. 
        The most common form of pollution caused upon the earth by us is Air Pollution, Land Pollution, Water Pollution, and Noise Pollution.
        This, in turn, had resulted in Ozone Layer Depletion and Global Warming.
        Due to ozone layer depletion, there harmful ultraviolet rays of the sun are reaching the earth. 
        It, in turn, is melting glaciers and causing a rise in temperature every year. 
        Many animals have either extinct or are endangered due to human activities.
        Some extinct animals worldwide are Sabre-toothed Cat, Woolly Mammoth, Dodo, Great Auk, Stellers Sea Cow, Tasmanian Tiger, Passenger Pigeon, Pyrenean Ibex. 
        The extinct animals in the Indian subcontinent are the Indian Cheetah, pink-headed duck, northern Sumatran rhinoceros, and Sunderban dwarf rhinoceros.
        The endangered animals that are in need of our immediate attention in India are Royal Bengal Tiger, Snow leopard, Red panda, Indian rhinoceros, Nilgiri tahr, 
        Asiatic lion, Ganges river dolphin, Gharial and Hangul, among others. We have exploited fossil fuels to such an extent that now we run the risk of using them completely. 
        We must switch to alternative sources of energy that are nature friendly. Solar power, windmills, hydra power should be used more often, and deforestation must be made illegal worldwide.
        We must come together to preserve the natural environment. Conversation, reduction, reuse and recycling of the resources will take us a long way in rebuilding the natural habitat.
        We are as unique as our planet earth. We have higher intelligence, and we must use it for the well-being of all living organisms. 
        The Earth is our natural abode, and we must make a place as close to Paradise, if not better.
